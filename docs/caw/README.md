# Project Docs

Harness policy and project documentation for a CAW project. Policy docs describe
*how to work*; durable state (story/task status, proof, decisions, traces) lives
in the DB and is queried with `scripts/caw/bin/harness-cli`.

## Policy docs (this folder)

| File | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `HARNESS.md` | The human–agent operating model: task loop, durable layer, growth-from-friction, done definition. |
| `FEATURE_INTAKE.md` | The intake gate — input types, risk checklist, and lane selection (tiny / normal / high_risk). |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architecture discovery questions and boundary rules (layering, parse-first, command/query). |
| `HARNESS_AUDIT.md` | What `harness-cli audit` checks and how the entropy score is computed. |
| `TOOL_REGISTRY.md` | Registering external project tools so agents can discover them. |

## File naming convention

Casing signals whether a file is read-only reference or something the project fills in:

- **`UPPER_CASE.md`** — **read-only guide / policy**. Canonical reference an agent
  *reads* to understand the harness; identical across every CAW project, never
  edited per-project (`HARNESS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TRACE_SPEC.md`, …).
  `README.md` is the one universal exception (always UPPER by convention).
- **`lower-case.md`** — **fill-in**: a file the project *writes into*. Two flavors:
  - *Format templates* (`templates/adr.md`, `templates/intake.md`) — copied/filled
    each time you create an instance.
  - *Project seed prose* (`conventions.md`, `knowledge.md`, `harness-backlog.md`) —
    scaffolded near-empty, then filled and appended to over the project's life.
- **`NNNN-*.md` / `US-*.md`** — content instances with an ID (`decisions/`, stories).

Rule of thumb: if an agent only ever *reads* it → UPPER; if the project *writes*
into it → lower.

## Layout of a CAW project

      conventions.md  knowledge.md  harness-backlog.md      # project seed prose

      decisions/      # ADR markdown (NNNN-*.md)

```

## Source of truth

- **State** (story/task status, lane, proof, decision status, traces, backlog) →
  the DB. Query it: `harness-cli query <table>`, `harness-cli matrix`.
- **Prose** (plan rationale, ADR content, narrative, conventions) → markdown
  under `docs/`.

One fact lives in exactly one place. Never restate task status in prose — the
`harness-cli lint` state-drift gate rejects it.
